# RandomX OpenCL implementation

This repository contains full RandomX implementation for AMD Vega GPUs. The latest version of RandomX (as of June 1st, 2019) is supported.

Note: it's only a benchmark/testing tool, not an actual miner. RandomX hashrate is expected to improve somewhat in the future thanks to further optimizations.

GPUs tested so far:

Model|CryptonightR H/S|RandomX H/S|Relative speed
-----|---------------|-----------|--------------
AMD Vega 64 (1700/1100 MHz)|2200|950|43.2%
